# Comparative-Analysis-of-Dimensionality-Reduction-Algorithms-and-Clustering-Algorithm

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of various unsupervised machine learning techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), clustering methods, and autoencoding. The project aims to compare these methods and analyze their effectiveness in dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

The dataset used in this project is related to ship engines and is intended for predictive maintenance. It includes various features relevant to engine performance and health
